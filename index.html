     <h2><strong>My Project</strong></h2>
  <div class="container"
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was Comet Catcher. Comet catcher is a marble drop game where people had to catch the marbles coming down. If enough marbles were caught then they would win a prize. We started this project at the start of term and market day was on week 8. we spent a lot of time on building the marble drop zone (12 full hours). Then we had to build the frame and code the vehicle we were using to catch the marbles.  
     I had chosen Digi for S2 but had not done it S1 and wasn't looking forward to it at first as I didn't know if any of my friends would be there. I eventully had Miglia join me just before S2 started. When I learnt that we were creating a carnivel game we had a few ideas. Miglia and I came up with the options of either cornhole or a marble drop. Eventully we decided on a marble drop</p>

     <p>Brainstoorming how to do it</p>
    <p>We decided we would use skewers and cardboard to create the 'drop zone' and ePro8 gear for a stand.</p>

    <p>EPro8 build</p>
    <p>For the stand we used the ePro8 kits. It was a 900 by 900mm frame on a slight tilt for the drop zone to fit on.   </p>
    <p>Canva build</p>
    <p>For marketing we used canva to make a poster. It was space themed and we designed it around the name of our game, Comet Catcher. </p>
    <p>Microbit build</p>
    <p>We ended up using a EV3 instead of a microbit to control the basket used to catch the marbles </p>
