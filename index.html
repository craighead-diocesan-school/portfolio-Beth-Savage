     <h2><strong>My Project</strong></h2>

    <img src="Comet Catcher poster.png"> 
     <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was Comet Catcher. Comet catcher is a marble drop game where people had to catch the marbles coming down. If enough marbles were caught then they would win a prize. We started this project at the start of term and market day was on week 8. we spent a lot of time on building the marble drop zone (12 full hours). Then we had to build the frame and code the vehicle we were using to catch the marbles.  
     I had chosen Digi for S2 but had not done it S1 and wasn't looking forward to it at first as I didn't know if any of my friends would be there. I eventully had Miglia join me just before S2 started. When I learnt that we were creating a carnivel game we had a few ideas. Miglia and I came up with the options of either cornhole or a marble drop. Eventully we decided on a marble drop</p>

  <p>We decided we would use skewers and cardboard to create the 'drop zone' and ePro8 gear for a stand. The stand was a 900 by 900mm frame on a slight tilt for the drop zone to fit on. We had to make measurements on how big the gaps between the skewers would be. The final measurements were 4.5 mm between all the skewers. With 200 skewers needed we had to work for a very long time to poke all the holes, cut all the skewers and poke all the skewers through.</p>

    <p>For marketing we used canva to make a poster(Shown at top). We also made a price sheet with a similar theme. We decided to use a space theme and designed it around the name of our game, Comet Catcher. </p>

    <p>We ended up using a EV3 instead of a microbit like the rest of the class to control the basket used to catch the marbles. We had to code it to move in two different directions which wasn't too hard. We used two of the buttons on the EV3 to move in the two different directions. The code we ended up with was when the button A was pressed the EV3 would move forward and when button D was pressed the EV3 would move backward </p>

    <p>In reflection I think market day was a success we made $26.50 and $8 in profet. I feel for a digi project we spent too much time on the build and not enough time on the coding. If we had more time and all the EV3 gear I think we should have connected 2 EV3s via radio signels for controling the basket.  </p>
